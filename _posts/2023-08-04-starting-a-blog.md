# Starting A Blog

I've decided to start a blog. I'm not entirely sure why. I like engineering and being a nerd. I get to nerd-out at work but I'm not allowed to share what I do with the outside world. I'm planning on only talking about things which are publicly available, so I don't get in trouble with work. So, my first blog post is about me trying to make a blog post. Much like the YouTube reviewers who review laptops and talk about its video editing capabilities because they edit videos all day, which is not an overly common thing to be doing on your laptop.

## So how hard is it to blog?
Well turns out there isn't really a centralised platform for blogging... vlogging is YouTube and pictures is Instagram.. maybe the blog site equivalent is medium? To be honest, I quite like that there is no central platform it feels more wild-west. I've seen this RSS stuff, but I've never used it before. Maybe I just don't read enough blogs. My favourite so far is WaitButWhys, but I only found out about this from Elon's Twitter.

I've decided to use GitHub Pages to do my blogging. I think GitHub is pretty cool and mysterious. I see it being used by all the software people and I want to learn more about it. Maybe this will help.

It's flippin tricky so far. I've made this Jekyll thing. Part of me was tempted to play around with HTML, CSS and JavaScript every night but I thought it would take forever. I've got future plans to make web pages and wanted to get on with my blog. After googling "github pages blog" I found [GitHub - skills/github-pages](https://github.com/skills/github-pages). I did all this (after getting to the click on "settings" step and clicking on the wrong gear icon many times..) and ended up with a theme, the Jekyll theme known as minima. This is what the site is currently using but I want to switch it to Chirpy. This, I have no clue how to do.

Originally I was hoping I could just change the one-line in the theme selector in the _config.yaml but the [GitHub Pages Supported Themes](https://pages.github.com/themes/) said otherwise. I was supposed to work out what the ```remote-theme``` should be from the "name of the theme as shown in the README of the theme's repository" ([source](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll)). But I can't find this in the Chirpy README. My main reason for wanting to use Chirpy is that I'm more of a dark mode guy and I watched [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8iOU1ci19Q&t=242s&ab_channel=TechnoTim) while brushing my teeth and thought it looked cooler than minima.

So, I've made another repository, based on Chirpy meaning this minima one might die. But my Chirpy website isn't working and now I'm lost and confused about GitHub Actions. I think they're just bash type scripts telling the GitHub computer to run some stuff but there is so much pre-populated content both in the .github/workflow/*.yml files and in the general Jekyll starter directory that it's super overwhelming. I find these "framework"/"library" things that software people make way too much to deal with. If you have to learn a programming language and a framework thing and GitHub, it's a bit much. This is why I quite like MATLAB and HTML, it starts with a single file. You know where the file is, what's in it and what runs when you click on it. I like functions, sometimes I'll find a MATLAB function, read the simple small documentation and be away. Maybe I can only get away with this because my programs are small. Oh yes, I like MATLAB, I've got the T-Shirt.
